#' Create explainer from your mlr model
#'
#' DALEX is designed to work with various black-box models like tree ensembles, linear models, neural networks etc.
#' Unfortunately R packages that create such models are very inconsistent. Different tools use different interfaces to train, validate and use models.
#' One of those tools, which is one of the most popular one is mlr3 package. We would like to present dedicated explain function for it.
